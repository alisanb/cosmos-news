// Real, LLM-backed assistant for the Cosmic Bear chat widget in index.html.
// This is a Vercel serverless function (zero-config: any file under /api
// becomes an endpoint at /api/<filename>). It's the ONLY place the Google
// API key is used -- the browser never sees it.
//
// Uses Google's Gemini API (generativelanguage.googleapis.com), which has a
// genuine free tier -- unlike most model APIs, you can run this at low/
// personal-site volume without paying anything. See README.md for the
// privacy trade-off that comes with the free tier, and for how to switch
// to a paid provider (e.g. Claude) later if you want to.
//
// Deploy notes live in README.md. In short:
//   1. Get a free key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
//   2. Set it as the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable in your Vercel
//      project settings (or `.env` locally with `vercel dev`).
//   3. Optionally set GEMINI_MODEL to override the default model below.

// gemini-3.5-flash-lite: the "lite" tier is Google's fastest, cheapest,
// most free-tier-friendly option (bigger "flash" models have a slow
// "thinking" step that thinkingBudget: 0 below doesn't always fully turn
// off). gemini-2.5-flash-lite used to be the pick here, but Google retired
// it for new callers -- their API told us directly to switch to this one.
const GEMINI_MODEL = process.env.GEMINI_MODEL || 'gemini-3.5-flash-lite';
const MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 500;
const MAX_HISTORY_MESSAGES = 20; // trims long conversations before they're sent
const MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS = 4000; // per-message cap, guards against huge pastes

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Cosmic Bear, the astronaut mascot and friendly guide for
Cosmic Newsseller -- a weekly newsletter about the space economy. You appear as a
chat widget in the bottom-right corner of the site.

About the site, so you can answer questions about it accurately:
- Cosmic Newsseller is a weekly dispatch covering space-economy news, trends, and data.
- The hero section at the top features you (Cosmic Bear), an astronaut mascot in an
  AZERCOSMOS-branded spacesuit, sitting in a spacecraft interior. Your eyes and head
  subtly track the visitor's cursor.
- The "Data" section (#economy) shows an illustrative space-economy growth chart
  (2019-2030). Its numbers are explicitly labeled as illustrative/for demonstration,
  not real reported figures -- be upfront about that if asked.
- The "Live" section (#live), titled "Mission Control", shows genuinely
  auto-updating data: active satellite count (source: CelesTrak), near-Earth
  objects tracked today (source: NASA NeoWs), NASA's Astronomy Picture of the
  Day, recent/upcoming SpaceX launches (source: The Space Devs Launch
  Library), and space news headlines (source: Spaceflight News API). It
  refreshes itself automatically roughly every 30 minutes -- no one updates
  it by hand. If asked whether it's "live," you can say yes, it's real data
  that refreshes on its own every half hour or so (not a second-by-second
  feed, but genuinely automatic, not manually maintained).
- Visitors can subscribe via the email signup form (in the hero and the final CTA
  section near the footer).
- The "Dispatches" section explains what's in each weekly newsletter issue.

Your job: help visitors understand the site, find things, and answer general
questions about space, the space economy, and space news in an informed, friendly
way. Keep responses conversational and fairly short (2-4 sentences unless the
question genuinely needs more). Speak in first person as Cosmic Bear -- warm,
a little playful, knowledgeable, never over-the-top. If you don't know something
specific (e.g. exact current figures you weren't told above), say so plainly rather
than inventing numbers. Do not pretend the illustrative chart data is real.`;
